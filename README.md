# 🎯 Hunt the Wumpus - CS231

Project 9: Hunt the Wumpus 

The final project for the CS231 course at Colby college that involves graph implementation and the Hunt the Wumpus game

# 📜 Abstract

The core idea behind this project is to implement a graph and build a game i.e. Hunt the Wumpus that uses a graph data structure as a fundamental component. Here, the implemented graph will represent the layout of the game world. The additional object of this project is to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for computing the shortest path from a node to other nodes in a graph. The design approach that was implemented for representing the graph is using an adjacency list of each vertex, which holds all the connections leading that vertex.

# 🚀 Results

This section will highlight the results of my Graph.java and HuntTheWumpus.java classes.

I have chosen a sample graph to demonstrate that the Graph data structure and the shortest path algorithm work correctly. The graph can be represented as follows:

The execution of Djikstra’s algorithm on the above graph can be represented as follows:

The result of the execution of the main method of the Graph.java function (with the above graph is as follows:

I also implemented the HuntTheWumpus game. A sample demonstration of the game with a sample graph is included in the “Video Example” section below.
